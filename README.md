**_Abstract -_** Medical image segmentation plays an important role in clinical decision making, treatment planning, and disease tracking. However, it still faces two major challenges. On the one hand, there is often a "soft boundary" between foreground and background in medical images, with poor illumination and low contrast further reducing the distinguishability of foreground and background within the image. On the other hand, co-occurrence phenomena are widespread in medical images, and learning these features is misleading to the model's judgment. To address these challenges, we propose a general framework called Contrast-Driven Medical Image Segmentation (ConDSeg). First, we develop a contrastive training strategy called Consistency Reinforcement. It is designed to improve the encoder's robustness in various illumination and contrast scenarios, enabling the model to extract high-quality features even in adverse environments. Second, we introduce a Semantic Information Decoupling module, which is able to decouple features from the encoder into foreground, background, and uncertainty regions, gradually acquiring the ability to reduce uncertainty during training. The Contrast-Driven Feature Aggregation module then contrasts the foreground and background features to guide multi-level feature fusion and key feature enhancement, further distinguishing the entities to be segmented. We also propose a Size-Aware Decoder to solve the scale singularity of the decoder. It accurately locate entities of different sizes in the image, thus avoiding erroneous learning of co-occurrence features. Extensive experiments on five medical image datasets across three scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, proving its advanced nature and general applicability to various medical image segmentation scenarios.

## Datasets📚
To verify the performance and general applicability of our ConDSeg in the field of medical image segmentation, we conducted experiments on five challenging public datasets: Kvasir-SEG, Kvasir-Sessile, GlaS, ISIC-2016, and ISIC-2017, covering subdivision tasks across three modalities. 

| Dataset      | Modality                  | Anatomic Region | Segmentation Target | Data Volume |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Kvasir-SEG   | endoscope                 | colon           | polyp               | 1000        |
| Kvasir-Sessile | endoscope               | colon           | polyp               | 196         |
| GlaS         | whole-slide image (WSI)   | colorectum      | gland               | 165         |
| ISIC-2016    | dermoscope                | skin            | malignant skin lesion | 1279       |
| ISIC-2017    | dermoscope                | skin            | malignant skin lesion | 2750       |

For Kvasir-SEG, we followed the official recommendation, using a split of 880/120 for training and validation. Kvasir-Sessile, a challenging subset of Kvasir-SEG, adopted the widely used split of 156/20/20 for training, validation, and testing as in [TGANet](https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/TGANet), [TGEDiff](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417424004147), etc. For GlaS, we used the official split of 85/80 for training and validation. For ISIC-2016, we utilized the official split of 900/379 for training and validation. For ISIC-2017, we also followed the official recommendation, using a split of 2000/150/600 for training, validation and testing.

## Getting Started🚀
### Data Preparation
The dataset should be organised as follows,taking Kvasir-SEG as an example:
```text
Kvasir-SEG
├── images
│   ├── cju0qkwl35piu0993l0dewei2.jpg
│   ├── cju0qoxqj9q6s0835b43399p4.jpg
│   ├── cju0qx73cjw570799j4n5cjze.jpg
│   ├── ...
├── masks
│   ├── cju0qkwl35piu0993l0dewei2.jpg
│   ├── cju0qoxqj9q6s0835b43399p4.jpg
│   ├── cju0qx73cjw570799j4n5cjze.jpg
│   ├── ...
├── train.txt
├── val.txt
```

### Training
- To train the first stage of ConDSeg, run: `train_stage1.py`.
- To train the second stage of ConDSeg, add the weights of the first stage to the `train.py` script and run it.

### Evaluation
- To evaluate the model and generate the prediction results, run: `test.py`.

### Another Version Using Transformer Encoder
If you are interested in the version of ConDSeg that uses the Pyramid Vision Transformer as the Encoder, please see `./network_pvt`.
